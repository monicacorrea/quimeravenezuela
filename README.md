# quimeravenezuela
This is a personal project.
When I read the book "Das Dritte Reich des Traums" I was very impressed by the way traumatic situations impacted the dreams of those affected.
I started to investigate on Twitter the stories of what Venezuelans dream about Venezuela. Many dreams are related to loss and violence; however, I prefer to rescue dreams related to hope and union.
